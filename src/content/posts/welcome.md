Welcome to **Archive** - a minimal collection and archive system built with Astro and the Chiri theme.

## What is Archive?

Archive is a simple yet powerful system for organizing your content into collections. Think of it as a digital library where you can:

- **Organize content** into themed collections (Thoughts, Media, Gallery, Projects, etc.)
- **Browse easily** with a clean, minimal interface
- **Navigate quickly** using the sidebar navigation and mobile menu
- **Read comfortably** with a distraction-free reading experience
- **Manage images** with organized `_assets` folders per collection

## Key Features

### Unified Collections System
Group related posts together in collections. The new system uses a **single source of truth** (`collections.config.ts`) making it easy to add or modify collections.

**Current Collections:**
- **Thoughts** - Reflections & ideas
- **Media** - Books, movies, music reviews
- **Gallery** - Photos & visuals
- **Projects** - Work & creativity

### Minimal Design
Built on the Chiri theme, Archive focuses on content with a clean, typography-first design.

### Easy Navigation
- **Sidebar navigation** (desktop) for quick access to Home, Collections, and Guide
- **Mobile menu** with hamburger icon for smaller screens
- **Smart back buttons** that return you to the right place
- **Collection pages** that list all posts with counts
- **Consistent layout** across all pages

### Organized Assets
Each collection has its own `_assets/` folder for images, keeping everything organized and portable.
