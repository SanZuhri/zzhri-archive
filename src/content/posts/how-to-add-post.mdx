Adding a post to your Archive is simple. This guide covers everything you need to know.

## Quick Start Flow

<FlowDiagram steps={postSteps} title="Post Creation Workflow" />

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Choose Your Collection

Pick the collection that fits your content:

| Collection | Folder | Purpose | URL Pattern |
|------------|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Thoughts** | `src/content/thoughts/` | Reflections & ideas | `/collections/thoughts/{slug}` |
| **Media** | `src/content/media/` | Books, movies, music | `/collections/media/{slug}` |
| **Gallery** | `src/content/gallery/` | Photos & visuals | `/collections/gallery/{slug}` |
| **Projects** | `src/content/projects/` | Work & creativity | `/collections/projects/{slug}` |
| **Posts** | `src/content/posts/` | Guides & docs | `/{slug}` |

**Tip:** Check `src/collections.config.ts` to see all available collections and their settings.

### Step 2: Create the File

Create a new file in your chosen collection folder:

**Examples:**

For a thought/reflection:
```bash
src/content/thoughts/life-lessons.md
```

For a media review:
```bash
src/content/media/favorite-book.md
```

For a gallery post:
```bash
src/content/gallery/sunset-photos.md
```

For a project:
```bash
src/content/projects/portfolio-website.md
```

**Naming Rules:**
- ‚úÖ Use lowercase letters
- ‚úÖ Use hyphens for spaces (`my-post` not `my_post` or `myPost`)
- ‚úÖ Be descriptive (`chocolate-cake` not `post1`)
- ‚ùå Avoid special characters (`!@#$%`)
- üí° File name becomes the URL slug

### Step 3: Add Frontmatter

Every post needs frontmatter at the top:

```markdown
---
title: 'Life Lessons from 2024'
pubDate: 2024-11-01
image: '/images/lessons.jpg'  # Optional
---
```

**Required Fields:**
- `title` - The post title (string)
- `pubDate` - Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)

**Optional Fields:**
- `image` - Featured image path (for OG images and thumbnails)

### Step 4: Write Your Content

After the frontmatter, write your content using Markdown:

```markdown
---
title: 'Life Lessons from 2024'
pubDate: 2024-11-01
---

This year has taught me valuable lessons...

## Lesson 1: Patience

Learning to be patient with myself...

## Lesson 2: Growth

Embracing change and personal growth...
```

### Step 5: Preview Your Post

**If dev server is already running:**
- Just save your file
- Refresh your browser
- Changes appear automatically! ‚ú®

**If dev server is not running:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and visit:
- For collection posts: `http://localhost:4321/collections/{collection}/{slug}/`
- For guide posts: `http://localhost:4321/{slug}/`

**Example URLs:**
- `http://localhost:4321/collections/thoughts/life-lessons/`
- `http://localhost:4321/collections/media/favorite-book/`
- `http://localhost:4321/how-to-add-post/` (guide post)

**Hot Reload:**
Posts in existing collections support hot reload - no need to restart the dev server!

## Markdown Features

Archive supports standard Markdown plus:

### Headings
```markdown
# H1 Heading
## H2 Heading
### H3 Heading
```

### Lists
```markdown
- Unordered item
- Another item

1. Ordered item
2. Another item
```

### Links
```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

### Images

**Option 1: Using _assets folder (Recommended)**
```markdown
![Alt text](./\_assets/my-image.jpg)
```

**Option 2: Using public folder**
```markdown
![Alt text](/images/my-image.jpg)
```

### Code Blocks
````markdown
```javascript
const hello = "world"
```
````

### Blockquotes
```markdown
> This is a quote
```

## Adding Images to Posts

Each collection has an `_assets/` folder for storing images. This keeps your content organized.

### Folder Structure

```
src/content/thoughts/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ _assets/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ photo1.jpg
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ photo2.png
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ my-post.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ another-post.md
```

### Using Images in Posts

**Step 1:** Add your image to the `_assets/` folder

```bash
src/content/thoughts/_assets/sunset.jpg
```

**Step 2:** Reference it in your post using relative path

```markdown
---
title: 'Beautiful Sunset'
pubDate: 2024-11-01
---

![Sunset at the beach](./\_assets/sunset.jpg)

This sunset was absolutely stunning...
```

### Image Path Options

| Method | Path | Use Case |
|--------|------|----------|
| **_assets (Recommended)** | `./\_assets/image.jpg` | Collection-specific images |
| **Public folder** | `/images/image.jpg` | Shared images across site |
| **External URL** | `https://...` | Images hosted elsewhere |

### Why Use _assets?

- ‚úÖ **Organized** - Images stay with their posts
- ‚úÖ **Portable** - Move collection folder, images come with it
- ‚úÖ **Clear** - Easy to see which images belong to which posts
- ‚úÖ **Clean** - No clutter in public folder

## Draft Posts

To create a draft post that won't appear on your site, prefix the filename with an underscore:

**Examples:**
```bash
src/content/thoughts/_work-in-progress.md
src/content/media/_draft-review.md
src/content/gallery/_example.md
```

**How it works:**
- ‚úÖ Files starting with `_` are ignored during build
- ‚úÖ They won't appear in post lists or be accessible via URL
- ‚úÖ Perfect for work-in-progress content
- ‚úÖ Remove the `_` prefix when ready to publish

## Tips for Great Posts

1. **Use descriptive titles** - Make it clear what the post is about
2. **Add headings** - Break up content with H2 and H3 headings
3. **Include images** - Visual content enhances readability
4. **Keep it focused** - One topic per post
5. **Proofread** - Check for typos and formatting issues

## Post URLs

Posts in different collections have different URL patterns:

- **Guide posts** (`posts` collection): `/{slug}`
  - Example: `/how-to-add-post/`
  
- **Collection posts**: `/collections/{collection}/{slug}`
  - Example: `/collections/thoughts/life-lessons/`
  - Example: `/collections/media/favorite-book/`

## Development Workflow

### Hot Reload (No Restart Needed)

When working on posts, you get instant feedback:

1. **Start dev server once:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Edit your posts:**
   - Save file
   - Refresh browser
   - See changes instantly!

3. **What works with hot reload:**
   - ‚úÖ Content changes
   - ‚úÖ Frontmatter updates
   - ‚úÖ New posts in existing collections
   - ‚úÖ Image additions
   - ‚úÖ Component edits

### When to Restart

Only restart if you:
- ‚ùå Add a new collection
- ‚ùå Edit config files
- ‚ùå Install new packages

**Quick restart:**
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C), then:
npm run dev
```
