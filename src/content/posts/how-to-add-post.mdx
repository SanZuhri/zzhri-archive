Adding a post to your Archive is simple. This guide covers everything you need to know.

## Quick Start Flow

<FlowDiagram steps={postSteps} title="Post Creation Workflow" />

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Choose Your Collection

Decide which collection your post belongs to:
- `src/content/astronomy/` - For astronomy posts
- `src/content/geography/` - For geography posts
- `src/content/literature/` - For literature posts
- `src/content/posts/` - For guide posts
- Or any custom collection you've created

### Step 2: Create the File

Create a new markdown file with a descriptive name:

```bash
src/content/astronomy/mars-exploration.md
```

**Naming Tips:**
- Use lowercase letters
- Use hyphens instead of spaces
- Be descriptive but concise
- Avoid special characters

### Step 3: Add Frontmatter

Every post needs frontmatter at the top:

```markdown
---
title: 'Mars Exploration: Past and Future'
pubDate: 2024-10-29
image: '/images/mars.jpg'  # Optional
---
```

**Required Fields:**
- `title` - The post title (string)
- `pubDate` - Publication date (YYYY-MM-DD format)

**Optional Fields:**
- `image` - Featured image path

### Step 4: Write Your Content

After the frontmatter, write your content using Markdown:

```markdown
---
title: 'Mars Exploration'
pubDate: 2024-10-29
---

Mars has fascinated humanity for centuries...

## Early Observations

The first telescopic observations...

## Modern Missions

Recent missions like Perseverance...
```

### Step 5: Preview and Build

Run the development server to preview:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

```

### Code Blocks

```
````

> This is a quote
```

## Draft Posts

To create a draft post that won't be published, prefix the filename with an underscore:

```bash
src/content/astronomy/_draft-post.md
```

Draft posts are automatically excluded from the site.

## Tips for Great Posts

1. **Use descriptive titles** - Make it clear what the post is about
2. **Add headings** - Break up content with H2 and H3 headings
3. **Include images** - Visual content enhances readability
4. **Keep it focused** - One topic per post
5. **Proofread** - Check for typos and formatting issues
