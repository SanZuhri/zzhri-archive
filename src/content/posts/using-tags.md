Tags help organize your content and make it easier for readers to discover related posts across different collections.

## Adding Tags to Posts

Add tags to any post by including them in the frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: 'Your Post Title'
pubDate: 2025-11-01
tags: ['tag1', 'tag2', 'tag3']
---
```

## Tag Best Practices

### Keep Tags Consistent

Use consistent naming for your tags:
- Use lowercase for consistency
- Use hyphens for multi-word tags (e.g., `web-development`)
- Avoid special characters

### Don't Overuse Tags

Aim for 2-5 relevant tags per post. Too many tags can dilute their usefulness.

### Think About Discovery

Choose tags that help readers discover related content:
- **Topics**: `astronomy`, `literature`, `travel`
- **Formats**: `tutorial`, `review`, `essay`
- **Themes**: `nature`, `technology`, `culture`

## Browsing Tags

### View All Tags

Visit [/tags/](/tags/) to see all available tags with post counts.

### Filter by Tag

Click any tag badge to see all posts with that tag. Tags appear:
- In post lists (below each post title)
- On individual post pages (below the title)
- On the tags index page

## Tag Pages

Each tag has its own page showing all posts with that tag, sorted by date. The URL format is `/tags/[tag-name]/`.

## Cross-Collection Tags

Tags work across all collections, making it easy to find related content regardless of where it's organized. For example, posts about "books" might appear in both the Media and Blog collections.
