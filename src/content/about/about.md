# Hi, I'm Zzhri ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm someone who loves learning, exploring, and documenting the journey along the way.

## What I Do

I'm passionate about collecting knowledge and organizing it in ways that make sense to me. This archive is my digital garden - a place where I cultivate ideas, document discoveries, and share what I'm learning about the world.

Photography captures creative moments, while thoughtful reflections shape my perspective. I enjoy creative projects that bring ideas to life, and find inspiration in books, music, movies, series, and anime. Technology fascinates me as I build tools and systems to organize information better.

This space is more than just a collection of notes - it's my attempt to make sense of the world, one topic at a time. I believe in the power of organized knowledge and the beauty of connecting seemingly unrelated ideas.

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to interesting conversations and new perspectives. Feel free to explore my collections, and if something resonates with you, I'd love to hear about it.
