Black holes are among the most fascinating objects in the universe. They are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from them.

## Formation

Black holes form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. The gravitational force becomes so intense that it warps spacetime itself.

## Types of Black Holes

- **Stellar Black Holes**: Formed from collapsed stars
- **Supermassive Black Holes**: Found at the centers of galaxies
- **Intermediate Black Holes**: Between stellar and supermassive
- **Primordial Black Holes**: Hypothetical, formed in the early universe
