Mountains have always captured human imagination. They represent challenges to overcome and natural beauty to admire.

## The Tallest Peaks

Mount Everest stands at 8,849 meters (29,032 feet) above sea level, making it the highest mountain on Earth. It's located in the Himalayas on the border between Nepal and Tibet.

## Mountain Formation

Mountains form through tectonic forces or volcanism. The Himalayas, for example, were formed by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates.
