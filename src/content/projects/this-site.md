I built this site because I needed a place to write. Not for an audience—for me. To think clearer, organize better, process emotions I don't always understand.

## Why Build It

I tried existing platforms. Medium wants you to chase claps. Notion feels like work. Social media is... well, you know. I wanted something different. Something quiet. A space where the only metric that matters is whether I actually wrote something.

So I built this. Took a theme I liked, stripped out everything unnecessary, and shaped it into something that feels right. No analytics tracking you. No comments begging for engagement. No newsletter popup. Just words and the space to read them.

## Design Philosophy

The design follows one principle: **less, but better**.<span class="sidenote">Dieter Rams said this about product design, but it applies to everything. Remove until you can't remove anymore.</span>

Everything here is intentional:
- **Typography** — Serif for reading, sans for UI. Proper spacing. Drop caps because they're beautiful and timeless.
- **No distractions** — No animations chasing trends. No effects that'll look dated next year.
- **Sidenotes** — For thoughts that don't fit inline but matter enough to include.<span class="marginnote">Like this. Borrowed from centuries of print design.</span>
- **Minimal navigation** — Collections, tags, archive. That's it. You don't need more.

## What I Learned

Building this taught me more than I expected:

### 1. Good Design is Invisible

The best design doesn't call attention to itself. You shouldn't notice the UI—you should notice the content. Every time I added something "cool," I had to ask: does this help or distract?

Most of the time, it distracted. So I removed it.

### 2. Constraints are Freeing

I limited myself to H2 headings in the table of contents. Only essential features. No fancy animations. These constraints didn't limit me—they freed me to focus on what matters.

### 3. Writing is Thinking

I knew this intellectually, but building a space dedicated to writing made it real. Every post forces clarity. You can't hide behind vague thoughts when you have to write them down.

## Technical Choices

For anyone curious about the technical side:

**Stack:**
- Astro for static generation
- Markdown for content
- CSS variables for theming
- No JavaScript frameworks

**Why these choices?**
- **Fast** — Static sites are instant
- **Simple** — Markdown is just text
- **Timeless** — No framework churn
- **Accessible** — Works everywhere, for everyone

The whole site is under 100KB. It loads instantly. It'll work on any device, any connection. That matters.

## What's Next

I don't have a roadmap. No feature list. No grand plans. I'll write when I have something to say. I'll adjust the design when something feels off. I'll add features only when I actually need them.

This site will grow the way gardens grow—slowly, organically, without force.

## For You

If you're thinking about building something similar, here's what I'd say:

**Start simple.** Don't wait for the perfect design or the perfect platform. Just start writing. The rest will follow.

**Remove more than you add.** Every feature has a cost. Every animation is a distraction. Every option is a decision. Less is usually better.

**Make it yours.** Don't copy what everyone else is doing. Build something that feels right to you. It's your space—own it.

The code is open source if you want to see how it's built. But honestly? The implementation doesn't matter as much as the intention. Build something that helps you think. Everything else is details.
